# Physical AI Jetson Robotics

Engineering platform for building, simulating, training, and deploying Physical AI systems with ROS 2, Isaac Sim, OpenUSD, LeRobot-style workflows, and NVIDIA Jetson edge hardware.

This repository is the flagship project in my AI systems portfolio. It connects robotics, simulation, edge AI, telemetry, and agentic operations into one reproducible path from digital twin to real hardware.

---

## Core Thesis

Physical AI systems need more than models.

They need:

- robot descriptions and simulation assets
- edge inference and runtime benchmarks
- ROS 2 control and telemetry
- OpenUSD / Isaac validation workflows
- sim-to-real deployment evidence
- safety-aware operations tooling
- agentic diagnostics over logs, docs, and robot state

This repository is designed to prove that full stack.

---

## What This Builds

- ROS 2 robot stacks for Yahboom ROSMASTER M3 Pro and Synria 6DOF arm workflows
- Isaac Sim / OpenUSD robot assets and factory-cell scenes
- MoveIt 2 and Gazebo smoke-test paths for robot description validation
- LeRobot-style training and reporting scaffolds for manipulation policies
- Jetson-oriented inventory, deployment, edge inference, and operations tooling
- RAG/agentic operations copilot experiments over robot telemetry and documentation
- AI-RAN and private 5G readiness concepts for robotics workloads

Canonical editable ROS 2 sources stay in `ros2_ws/src/*_description/urdf/`. Isaac folders keep generated/import-ready copies.

## Engineering Principles

- simulation first, real robot second
- reproducible setup over one-off demos
- explicit safety boundaries for robot actions
- benchmarked edge deployment
- observable systems with telemetry and logs
- business justification attached to technical tracks
- no production claims without evidence

---

## Current Status

This is an active engineering platform, not a finished product.

Current maturity:

> Working foundation with simulation, robot-description, CLI, training, and evidence scaffolds. Real hardware proof and runtime benchmark artifacts are being added incrementally.
