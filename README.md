# Physical AI Jetson Robotics Lab

Production-ready Physical AI lab for NVIDIA Jetson Thor and Jetson Orin robotics: OpenUSD digital twins, Isaac Sim/Isaac Lab training, ROS 2 SLAM, edge vision, robotic arm control, and sim-to-real deployment.

## Mission

This repository is designed as a real-world robotics engineering portfolio project, not a notebook demo. It connects simulation, robot learning, edge AI, and field deployment into one practical lab for:

- autonomous robo car navigation and SLAM
- robotic arm manipulation and sim-to-real transfer
- OpenUSD digital twin scenes for synthetic data and validation
- Jetson Thor/Orin edge inference and benchmarking
- robot operations telemetry, RAG, and agentic diagnostics
- AI-RAN/private 5G readiness for smart factory and edge robotics workloads

Signature project thesis:

> Physical AI Operations Stack for Mobile Manipulation: OpenUSD digital twins, Isaac training, ROS 2 deployment, Jetson edge inference, robot telemetry, safety/readiness scoring, and an agentic operations copilot.

## Why It Matters

Modern robotics teams need systems that can be trained in simulation, validated against digital twins, deployed on edge hardware, and monitored in production. This project demonstrates that full path using tools and patterns aligned with physical AI, industrial automation, autonomous systems, and edge intelligence.

Business use cases include:

- smart factory robot fleet monitoring
- warehouse AMR navigation and congestion avoidance
- robotic arm inspection, sorting, and pick-place tasks
- private 5G / AI-RAN edge robotics workload planning
- synthetic data generation for computer vision and safety testing

## Quick Start

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
physical-ai-lab demo-telemetry
```

### Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q

## Current Status

Milestone 1 is the production foundation:

- cross-platform Python package

Hardware integration, ROS 2 packages, Isaac scenes, and Jetson deployment scripts will be added incrementally.

## First Hardware Evidence

After setup, collect inventory evidence from each machine:

Windows:

```powershell

```

Linux RTX:

```bash
bash scripts/linux_rtx/collect_inventory.sh
```

Jetson:

```bash
bash scripts/jetson/collect_inventory.sh jetson-orin reports/inventory/yahboom_orin_nx.json
```

Then complete the relevant report template:

- [Yahboom Bring-Up Template](reports/yahboom/BRINGUP_TEMPLATE.md)
